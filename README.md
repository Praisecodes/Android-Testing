# Android-Testing
An app just created to test Mobile applicationdevelopment and to refresh my memory.

## Years Calculator app.
This Android Application was written using:<br />
- __*Java*__ and<br />
- __*XML*__<br />
All source code for this application is here in this
repository and so you can enjoy going through the code.

## What does it do?
Basically, what the app does is that it takes two inputs
from the user; the first is:<br />
- __*User's name*__: In this field, the user of the
application can input he's full name or even just one
name and the then move on to the next input which is the<br />

- __*User's Year Of Birth*__: This field only accepts numbers
as input and so anything else can't work.<br /> For this
reason, when this field has gained focus, the keypad only
shows numbers, in other words, the numeric keyboard comes up.<br />

- __*Display Box*__: This is the part of the app where
the information gathered via your inputted data is outputted.
Simply put, this box is at the bottom center of the screen
and this box is there to show you the final result of what 
the data you've given to the app.

## How it works
So now let's take a little example here to try explain how it all works.<br />
Let's assume your name is __*Prince Codes*__ or __*Oladele Precious*__ 
and you were born in the year __*1997*__<br /><br />In 
this app, you're simply going to write your name in the space 
given for names and then write your birth year in the 
input box directly below that of the names, then click 
__CHECK__. In the __*Display Box*__, you're automatically going 
to see the following message: __*"Hello there Oladele Precious, this
year is your 24 year on Earth."*__ or __*"Hello there Prince Codes, this
year is your 24 year on Earth."*__ <br /> 

The number 24 is gotten
by simply subtracting your birth year from the current year.<br />
Having said all that, enjoy the code ❤️.
